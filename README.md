# Christianity Corner

I am a Christian, and the Bible version I like the best is the Authorised<br>
King James Version, as it is very accurate and brings out the best of the<br>
English language.<br>
<br><br>
The Sections are as follows:<br>
<br>
01-kjvbible --- The KJV-1900, also known as the Pure Cambridge Edition.<br>
<br>
02-biblestudy --- Various studies in the Bible, including Study Bibles.<br>
<br>
03-readingplans --- Read through the Bible in 1 or 2 years, based on M'Cheyne.<br>
<br>
