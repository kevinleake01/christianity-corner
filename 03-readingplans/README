# Bible Reading Plans

M'Cheyne's Bible Reading plan was first published in 1843, and is
the earliest lectionary that covers 100% of the Bible. Using this
plan, you will cover the Old Testament once and the New Testament
and Psalms twice in a year. You may if you wish read the chapters
named "Family" in Year 1, and "Secret" in Year 2 therefore covering
the plan in 2 Years.
